This project is composed of two parts:

Part 1:
This program prompts the user for total sales for the month, and then calculates the county, state, and total sales tax.

Part 2:
This program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number.  It replies if the guess is too high or too low, and congratulates the user when the guess the number.  The game restarts with a new random number after a correct guess.
